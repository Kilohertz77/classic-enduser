If you lack access to a server that meets Omeka's [basic requirements](../Installation/System_Requirements/), try our [Omeka.net](http://omeka.net) hosted service.

Many hosting companies offer one-click or similarly simple installations of Omeka, often using [Installatron](https://installatron.com/omeka?s=4808f3ca0bb48ec1d0f6d387fddf14fd). You can find a list of hosting providers using Installatron [on their site](https://installatron.com/partners).

For academic users of Omeka, we recommend Reclaim Hosting <https://reclaimhosting.com/> which is specifically geared toward academic users - students, faculty, and institutions. Reclaim offers one-click installations for Omeka and Omeka S installations, and for other open-source software platforms, as well as robust customer support.
